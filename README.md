<h1 align="center">Hello, I am Vitalia 👋</h1>
<h3 align="center">Data Scientist & Backend Engineer | Bridging the gap between Finance and Technology</h3>

## About Me: 
I am a Data Scientist and Engineer with a unique background blending five years of experience in the Swiss financial sector with an MSc in Applied Information and Data Science. My passion lies in building robust, end-to-end solutions that leverage data to drive business value. I specialize in developing automated data pipelines, deploying machine learning models, and building the backend infrastructure that brings data-driven applications to life. My journey from finance to tech has given me a strong business acumen and a deep appreciation for creating scalable and impactful solutions.

Currently, I'm working as a Backend Systems Engineer, where I'm diving deep into:

* 🏗️ Building and maintaining data infrastructure with PostgreSQL, SQL, and Python.

* 🤖 Implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for intelligent chatbots.

* 💡 Exploring the application of digital twins and other advanced AI features.
